    Text: @gringahugasan @bingbing_zee I did and will continue to. I've learned more about science, religion, philosophy, history &amp; politics on Wikipedia than in school. History textbooks don't even mention how bad the Marcosian economy was nor even detail Marcos' atrocities. https://t.co/XVz8q52co2

    Text: According to the resolution:

“Marcos is the candidate whose vision of governance is most aligned with PDP Laban’s 11-point agenda,” the Cusi-led party added. The group also noted it had previously endorsed Marcos’ running mate, Sara Duterte-Carpio, as its official VP candidate. https://t.co/8a4IIFan7p

    Text: One of the most wealthy and successful men in Argentina openly supporting Javier Milei. 

Marcos is the founder of Mercardo Libre (the Free Market). It's an online marketplace where Argies can buy and sell things - very similar to Amazon and eBay.

    Text: The Marcos brand of governance is governing through public relations. No real accomplishments, just the perception of it. And somehow, with the right mix of things, it works.

I call it a postmodernist model of governance. Its governing without having to govern at all.

    Text: Atty @LukeEspirituPH on why the masses should not be blamed for electing Marcos into power. They are victims of fear and repression by the ruling class. Bitter pill to swallow rn as we mourn the Marcos comeback but there is wisdom in what he said. https://t.co/ExBcwPLRGT

    Text: I found De Vega's views on censorship "out-of-character" so I checked with other writers what they thought. Very conflicting assessments of his brief time as the chief of censor, but they all agree that the guiding philosophy behind Marcosian film censorship was... liberalism.

    Text: Our construct of Marcos is based on the values we uphold, that is, we are against authoritarian and autocratic leadership and abusive government. Our construct of Marcos is also corroborated by the actual and lived experiences and written documents, both historical and legal.

    Text: A religião faz o crente acreditar que justiça é o mesmo que juízo. Este não anseia mais ser justo; seu desejo é tornar-se juiz. O militante da religião estabeleceu um propósito: ao invés do ajuste e da reparação, sua grande obsessão é a vingança.

    Text: Exactly what Ka Percy warned us “Papunta na tayo sa bangin” kung umupo si Marcos. I am not even a fan of this radio commentator. But I am watching past vlogs now. 

Bong Bong Marcos has no vision for the country. His father left him with a “blue print” public knowledge naman what…

    Text: 5. Marcos is not genuinely interested in helping the economy. He is a believer of dole outs to pacify clamor — kadiwa, nutribun, infra projects, etc. He has no agenda to establish industries and rebuilding the economy.

"मार्कोस की तरह भागना पड़ेगा इनको!" 

कुछ महीने पहले ही लालू जी ने यह सटीक अनुमान लगाया था।

कौन मार्कोस?

1965 से 1986 तक फ़िलीपीन्स के राष्ट्रपति रहे मार्कोस फर्डिनेंड को व्यापक जन दबाव के चलते अपना मुल्क छोड़कर अमेरिका भागना पड़ा था।

2. Kilalanin mo ang kalaban. Kilalanin mo ang sarili mo.

3. Avoid what is strong, attack what is weak (Art of War) 

4. Wag kang aatake base lang sa nararamdaman mo o sa pride mo.

    Text: Marcos was a member of LP. Failing to secure LP's nomination as presidential candidate (because Macapagal decided to run for second term), he moved to Nacionalista Party. He won under NP and defeated his former partymate. Later he left NP and formed Kilusang Bagong Lipunan. https://t.co/iDq8Vsw0wH
