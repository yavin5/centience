    Text: 5. Marcos is not genuinely interested in helping the economy. He is a believer of dole outs to pacify clamor — kadiwa, nutribun, infra projects, etc. He has no agenda to establish industries and rebuilding the economy.

    Text: The Marcos brand of governance is governing through public relations. No real accomplishments, just the perception of it. And somehow, with the right mix of things, it works.

I call it a postmodernist model of governance. Its governing without having to govern at all.

    Text: According to the resolution:

Marcos is the founder of Mercardo Libre (the Free Market). It's an online marketplace where Argies can buy and sell things - very similar to Amazon and eBay.

"मार्कोस की तरह भागना पड़ेगा इनको!" 

कुछ महीने पहले ही लालू जी ने यह सटीक अनुमान लगाया था।

कौन मार्कोस?

1965 से 1986 तक फ़िलीपीन्स के राष्ट्रपति रहे मार्कोस फर्डिनेंड को व्यापक जन दबाव के चलते अपना मुल्क छोड़कर अमेरिका भागना पड़ा था।

    Text: Ganito, 

1. Wag mong ipapaalam sa kalaban mo na kalaban ka nila.

2. Kilalanin mo ang kalaban. Kilalanin mo ang sarili mo.

3. Avoid what is strong, attack what is weak (Art of War) 

4. Wag kang aatake base lang sa nararamdaman mo o sa pride mo.

    Text: A religião faz o crente acreditar que justiça é o mesmo que juízo. Este não anseia mais ser justo; seu desejo é tornar-se juiz. O militante da religião estabeleceu um propósito: ao invés do ajuste e da reparação, sua grande obsessão é a vingança.
